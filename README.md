### Description
This is the clustering project I had done at LUT University. The project is about a dataset (“Wine_data”) which is the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The task will be to find similarities of different types of wine by
grouping them via clustering.
The information of the variables in the data set are as follows:
- TYPE: The type of wine, into one of three categories 1, 2, and 3
- ALCOHOL: Alcohol in %
- MALIC: Malic acid
- ASH: Ash
- ALCALINITY: Alcalinity of ash
- MAGNESIUM: Magnesium
- PHENOLS: Total phenols
- FLAVANOIDS: Flavanoids
- NONFLAVANOIDS: Nonflavanoid phenols
- PROANTHOCYANINS: Proanthocyanins
- COLOR: Color intensity
- HUE: Hue
- DILUTION: D280/OD315 of diluted wines
- PROLINE: Proline
